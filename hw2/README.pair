1.  I wrote part 1 while my partner wrote most of part 2.
    We both wrote our own rspec in order to get the pratice.

2.  I had less parts to work on.

3.  How to figure out how to share code. Instead of Dropbox, we
    tried to set up a public git repository. That gave us headaches.

4.  Working face to face would've been easier, since we had problems
    communicating at times.
